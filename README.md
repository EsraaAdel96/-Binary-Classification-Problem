# -Binary-Classification-Problem

steps before 
- The data in excel sheet is cluttered, so I need to organize it in excel sheet and 2 values in each cell is existed in some columns so I separate them into 2 columns 
- Remove features or variables which are not important in datasets.
- Datasets have many character values so I should convert them to numeric value (creating dummy variables).
- Datasets have NaN in cells (missing data) ,I deleted them or replaced them by the mean. 
- Datasets have big values and small values so I should scale features to can use them.
