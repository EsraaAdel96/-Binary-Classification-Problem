# -Binary-Classification-Problem

First step
- The data in excel sheet is cluttered, so you need to organize it in excel sheet and separate columns which these cells have 2 
values separated by comma "," .
- Remove features or variables which are not important in datasets.
- Datasets have many character values so you should convert them to numeric value (creating dummy variables).
- Datasets have NaN in cells (missing data) , delete them or replace them by the mean. 
- Datasets have big values and small values so you should scale features to can use them.
